What the program does so far:
Takes information provided in the test.java file and runs it through the Bullet and Kit class to get/set the information to calculate a ballistic trajectory

What it still needs to do:
  GUI
  Store Bullet and Kit info in a file (Database or even just txt files we can read/write through the Bullet and Kit class)
  Calculate MIL(Angle of the barrel in 1/60ths of an degree) using velocity, scope height and zero distance
